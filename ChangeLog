FloodServ Module for NeoStats Changelog.
==============================================================================
3.0.a2-dev - Mark (M)

3.0.a1 - Mark (M)
 - Add action options to flood events. We can now warn only or lock channels
   for a join flood. (M).
 - Associate flood structures with channel/user so we get faster lookups on a
   given event. (M).
 - Allocate user structures at signon and delete on quit, and allocate channel 
   structures on newchan and delete on delchan. This reduces the need for 
   timers to clean lists.
 - Initial version to replace SecureServ flood checks. (M).
